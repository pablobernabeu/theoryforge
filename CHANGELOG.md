# Changelog

All notable changes to theoryforge (the R and Python twin packages) are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The two packages share a
version and a single behavioural contract ([`API_SPEC.md`](API_SPEC.md)).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-24

This is the first public release, a rigorous, reproducible workflow for theory building, development, and
testing, delivered as feature-parity R (CRAN) and Python (PyPI) packages.

### Core (P0)
- `theory.schema.json` + `rigor_checklist.yaml` as the shared, versioned source of truth.
- Theory-object I/O and structural validation (`read`/`write`/`validate`).
- The 12-item machine-checkable rigour checklist with weighted aggregate score and a blocker gate (`check`/`report`).
- Diagram intermediate representations: nomological net, provenance, causal DAG (`diagram`).
- Deterministic lexical construct-redundancy screen (`redundancy_check`).

### Workflow modes (P1)
- BUILDING: a fluent builder API with auto-logged provenance (`new_theory`/`tf_theory` + `add_*`/`tf_add_*`).
- TESTING: an operationalised severity rubric (`severity`) and preregistration export (`preregister`).
- DEVELOPMENT: Lakatosian progressive/degenerating amendment appraisal (`appraise_amendment`).
- Two further diagrams: development roadmap and hypothesis→tested-theory pipeline.
- A `draft` maturity state that runs the checklist in advisory (non-blocking) mode.

### Bibliometric layer (P2)
- `read_corpus`, `litmap` (keyword co-occurrence, deterministic connected-component themes, co-citation).
- `landscape`: maps a theory and its alternatives onto themes, flagging under-theorized fronts and redundancy risk.
- `lit_diagram` (keyword co-occurrence, co-citation, theme landscape) and a parity-exempt OpenAlex `fetch_corpus` adapter.

### SEM compilation and audit bundle (P3)
- `compile_sem`: compile constructs + propositions to lavaan model syntax.
- `dossier`: a reviewer-facing Markdown audit bundle (rigour report + severity + provenance + preregistration).

### Simulation, reporting & adapters (P4)
- `simulate`: a deterministic dynamical-system runner derived from the construct network (parity-tested trajectories).
- `render_report`: a Quarto report wrapping the deterministic audit dossier.
- `embedding_redundancy`: an opt-in, parity-exempt embedding screen (pluggable embedder), complementing the default lexical screen.
- `osf_push`: an OSF deposit adapter (dry-run by default, with a live upload requiring the user's token).

### Visualization and references
- Ten diagram views via `diagram`/`tf_diagram`: nomological net, provenance, causal DAG, development roadmap, pipeline, and the new `context` (the theory, its scope, and its rivals), `workflow` (the building-to-testing pipeline), `venn` (construct scope overlap), `rigor` (the checklist as a colour-coded status grid), and `severity` (per-prediction severity bars). The last three are returned as SVG.
- A "Methodological foundations" documentation page that cites the verified literature behind each rigour item, with DOIs. The machine-readable BibTeX ships with the R package at `inst/REFERENCES.bib`. The risk-severity item's citation was corrected after a Crossref re-audit (Cohen, 1992 removed as not supporting prediction severity).

### Quality & reproducibility
- Cross-language parity enforced over 54 golden artifacts in CI, with byte-identical diagrams (DOT and SVG), markdown, and lavaan outputs and semantically-equal JSON.
- R passes `R CMD check --as-cran` with 0 errors and 0 warnings (1 note, the standard new-submission note). Python builds a wheel and sdist passing `twine check`, is ruff- and mypy-clean, and ships `py.typed`.
- Test suites: Python (pytest) and R (testthat), plus a dedicated parity job.

### Not yet implemented
- A live OSF upload requires the user's own token. `osf_push` ships with a dry-run default.
- Richer (nonlinear / agent-based) computational-model runners, and first-class embedding-model integrations beyond the pluggable `embedding_redundancy` interface.
